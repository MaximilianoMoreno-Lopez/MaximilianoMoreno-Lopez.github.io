## Welcome

I’m **Maximiliano Moreno-López**, a PhD candidate at the **Paris School of Economics – Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne**, supported by the **Ramón Areces Foundation**.

My research lies at the intersection of **environmental and energy policy**, **inequality**, and **computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling**. I’m particularly interested in how climate policy affects income distribution, and how economic modeling can guide fair and effective decarbonization strategies.

I work under the supervision of [**Lucas Chancel**](https://lucaschancel.com/en/), [**Katheline Schubert**](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/personnes/katheline-schubert/), and [**Mouez Fodha**](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/personnes/mouez-fodha/), contributing to research that evaluates the **distributional and macroeconomic impacts** of environmental transition policies.
