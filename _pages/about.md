## Welcome

I'm **Maximiliano Moreno-López**, a PhD candidate at the **Paris School of Economics (Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne)**.

My research focuses on **environmental and energy policy**, **inequality**, and **computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling**. I'm particularly interested in how climate policies affect income distribution and how economic models can be used to design fairer transitions to sustainability.

I am currently funded by the **Ramón Areces Foundation**, and I contribute to research projects evaluating the distributional impacts of climate policies.
