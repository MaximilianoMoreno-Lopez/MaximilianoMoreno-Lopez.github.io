I’m **Maximiliano Moreno-López**, a PhD candidate at the **Paris School of Economics** – Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, supported by the Fundación Ramón Areces.

My research lies at the intersection of **environmental and energy policy** & **inequality**. I’m particularly interested in how climate change and environmental policy affects income distribution, and how economic modeling can guide fair and effective decarbonization strategies.

I work under the supervision of [**Lucas Chancel**](https://lucaschancel.com/en/), [**Katheline Schubert**](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/personnes/katheline-schubert/) and [**Mouez Fodha**](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/personnes/mouez-fodha/), contributing to research that evaluates the **distributional and macroeconomic impacts** of environmental transition policies. 

I also collaborate with the **French Ministry for the Ecological Transition**, through the Commissariat Général au Développement Durable, contributing to research on the macroeconomic and distributional impacts of climate policies. Previously, I have worked with the **Bank of Spain**, the **Spanish Economic and Social Council** and **Universidad de Alcalá de Henares**, participating in policy-oriented economic analysis related to inequality, sustainability, and energy transitions.
